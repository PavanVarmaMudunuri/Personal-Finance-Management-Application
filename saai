Project DockOne: AI-Powered Optimization of Hiring and Onboarding Process
-	l

1. Problem Statement
The current onboarding and hiring process is slow due to manual operations, causing waiting times of up to 3 days for new hires to complete onboarding. Additionally, issues with logistical coordination result in a suboptimal candidate experience. These challenges not only affect the experience of new hires but also disrupt daily operational workflows, ultimately impacting both candidate satisfaction and organizational challenges.
These challenges:
•	Burden departments involved in onboarding (HR, IT & Admin Support)
•	Reduce candidate satisfaction
•	Impact operational efficiency and time-to-productivity
2. Objective
To streamline the onboarding process using Generative AI (GenAI) and Python, by:
•	Automating repetitive HR tasks (e.g., document generation, reminders)
•	Enhancing communication via AI-powered assistants
•	Improving transparency and coordination between stakeholders
•	Reducing overall onboarding time

3. Tools & Technologies (TBD)
Component	Technology
Programming Language	Python 3.x
AI Model	OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-4o
Backend Framework	FastAPI / Flask
UI Dashboard	Streamlit / Dash
Database	PostgreSQL / SQLite
Automation	Python (cron, Celery)
Communication APIs	Gmail API, Slack, SendGrid

4. Functional Components
4.1 Long-Term Reminder System
•	Remind patients to schedule routine checkups every 6–12 months via app, SMS, WhatsApp
•	Maintain daily hygiene habits (brushing, rinsing, flossing)
4.2 Wellness Tracker
A simple log (digital or paper-based) to monitor:
•	Any recurring pain or discomfort
•	Oral health symptoms
•	Medication side effects (if still on any dental meds)
4.3 Emergency Support Line
Dedicated helpline or chatbot:For elderly patients or caregivers to consult when issues arise unexpectedly
4.4 Periodic Engagement from Dental Clinic
Semi-annual check-in via phone or SMS:
•	Ask about any dental issues
•	Offer to schedule routine visits
•	Reinforce hygiene education
o	

4.4 Onboarding Tracker Dashboard
•	Visual dashboard showing onboarding progress across departments
•	Built using Stream lit or Dash

4.5 Email and Reminder System
•	Sends automatic:
o	Welcome messages
o	Daily reminders
o	Escalation alerts to stakeholders

5. Implementation Plan
Phase 1 – MVP
•	Offer letter & document generation using GPT
•	Automated emails and reminders
•	Simple front-end dashboard
Phase 2 – Coordination Automation
•	Integration with IT and HR tools
•	Task scheduler for follow-ups
•	GPT-based FAQ chatbot
Phase 3 – Full Integration
•	Secure user authentication (JWT/OAuth)
•	Feedback loop for prompt tuning
•	Real-time status updates across departments
 
 
6. Success Metrics
Metric	Target
Time-to-onboard	< 2 days (from 4 days)
Reduction in manual effort	≥ 30%
Candidate satisfaction	+20% improvement
HR productivity	+50% efficiency gain
7. Risks
•	Errors in code
•	Glitches (system, compatibility)
•	New hires may withdraw application
